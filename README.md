# INF554-Predict-missing-links-in-citation-network

Machine learning challenge conducted in the frame of course INF554: Machine Learning I by Prof. Michalis Vazirgiannis.

Edges have been deleted at random from a citation network. The goal is to accurately reconstruct the initial network using graph-theoretical, textual, and other information.

In this competition, a citation network is defined as a graph where nodes are research papers and there is an edge between two nodes if one of the two papers cite the other.
